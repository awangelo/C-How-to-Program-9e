a) Assume that struct card contains two const char * pointers named face
and suit. Also, the variable c is a struct card, and the variable cPtr is a
pointer to struct card. Variable cPtr has been assigned the address of c.
printf("%s\n", *cPtr->face);

printf("%s\n", cPtr->face);


b) Assume that struct card contains two const char * pointers named face
and suit. Also, the array hearts[13] is an array of type struct card. The
following statement should print the member face of array element 10.
printf("%s\n", hearts.face);

printf("%s\n", hearts[13].face);


c) union values {
char w;
float x;
double y;
};
union values v = {1.27};

1.27 to char?


d) struct person {
char lastName[15];
char firstName[15];
unsigned int age;
}

};


e) Assume struct person has been defined as in part (d) but with the appro-
priate correction.
person d;

struct person d;


f) Assume variable p has type struct person and the variable c is a struct
card.
p = c;
